Today I studied from page 147 to 156, $((156-147)) pages :)
The subject was Writing simple Shell scripts using
- escape characters
- variables
- variables expansion
- shebang lines 
- use of  '' `` "" 
- parameter expansion (chopping and expanding unset variables)
- if then else statements
- test expressions

As a project I performed

- Creating a remote git repo for my studies of this book
- Creating an Alias to set the date on this journal and setting it on ~/.bashrc
(Sources p. 68;81;84)
alias today="date +'%A, %B %d, %Y'"
- Creating a dummy script, in which I got help from :

Today I studied from page 156 to 164
I reviewed more commands I can use on scripts such as
- sed
- tr
- cut
- for 
- do while
- do until
- conditionals
- grep 

as projects I did a lot of different silly script, my favorite is a 2 line
backup script that will compress and save all my home directories on a 
share I have mounted on the system.

Next topic is Chapter 8 Learning System Administration , can't wait!
