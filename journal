Today I studied from page 147 to 156, $((156-147)) pages :)
The subject was Writing simple Shell scripts using
- escape characters
- variables
- variables expansion
- shebang lines 
- use of  '' `` "" 
- parameter expansion (chopping and expanding unset variables)
- if then else statements
- test expressions

As a project I performed

- Creating a remote git repo for my studies of this book
- Creating an Alias to set the date on this journal and setting it on ~/.bashrc
(Sources p. 68;81;84)
alias today="date +'%A, %B %d, %Y'"
- Creating a dummy script, in which I got help from :

Today I studied from page 156 to 164
I reviewed more commands I can use on scripts such as
- sed
- tr
- cut
- for 
- do while
- do until
- conditionals
- grep 

as projects I did a lot of different silly script, my favorite is a 2 line
backup script that will compress and save all my home directories on a 
share I have mounted on the system.

Next topic is Chapter 8 Learning System Administration , can't wait!

I installed cockpit on a test RHEL vm, I was surprised it looks really polished
even though it feels sluggish for something thats locally hosted. I found it 
pretty good. 

I was able to perform security updates from the cockpit webapp.
Whatched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kl62YSU9XA to learn more 
about systemd commands like systemctl and journalctl 
studied from page 167 to 184

Today I did not move futher on the book but I watched a 45min video from 
LearnLinux TV on systemd, I did as I believe the book was glossing over this
subject way too much.

Tomorrow I'll do the same but for learning more about journalctl

As a project I did a bash script that allows you to install a package and tell
you exactly what services haven installed, using
sytemctl list-unit --type:service

chapter.

Also studied a bit on how to manage and monitor hardware and modules using
commands like

lscpu,lspci,lsusb,lsmod,modprobe,rmmod

Today I'll review the chapter for Installing linux
