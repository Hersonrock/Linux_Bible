The subject was Writing simple Shell scripts using
- escape characters
- variables
- variables expansion
- shebang lines 
- use of  '' `` "" 
- parameter expansion (chopping and expanding unset variables)
- if then else statements
- test expressions

As a project I performed

- Creating a remote git repo for my studies of this book
- Creating an Alias to set the date on this journal and setting it on ~/.bashrc
(Sources p. 68;81;84)
alias today="date +'%A, %B %d, %Y'"
- Creating a dummy script, in which I got help from :

Today I studied from page 156 to 164
I reviewed more commands I can use on scripts such as
- sed
- tr
- cut
- for 
- do while
- do until
- conditionals
- grep 

as projects I did a lot of different silly script, my favorite is a 2 line
backup script that will compress and save all my home directories on a 
share I have mounted on the system.

Next topic is Chapter 8 Learning System Administration , can't wait!

I installed cockpit on a test RHEL vm, I was surprised it looks really polished
even though it feels sluggish for something thats locally hosted. I found it 
pretty good. 

I was able to perform security updates from the cockpit webapp.
Whatched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kl62YSU9XA to learn more 
about systemd commands like systemctl and journalctl 
studied from page 167 to 184

Today I did not move futher on the book but I watched a 45min video from 
LearnLinux TV on systemd, I did as I believe the book was glossing over this
subject way too much.

Tomorrow I'll do the same but for learning more about journalctl

As a project I did a bash script that allows you to install a package and tell
you exactly what services haven installed, using
sytemctl list-unit --type:service

Today I studied from 184 to 195 Finished the Linux system administrator 
chapter. 

Learned about systemd and its commands systemctl and journalctl

Also studied a bit on how to manage and monitor hardware and modules using
commands like

lscpu,lspci,lsusb,lsmod,modprobe,rmmod

Today I'll review the chapter for Installing linux

Today I read through chapter 9 Installing Linux.
The chapter was easy to read as I'm not new at installing linux.
Regardless it provides good references such as Boot options to troubleshoot
problematic features and Video problems.

Today I installed Arch Linux on a VM to practice the chapter 9 which was about
installing linux. I plan to install it on my actual hardware later, perhaps 
have a dual boot with it. 
I was thinking I should be able to confortably make it my daily driver.

Today I finished chapter 10 which was about understanding Linux RPM and DEB 
packages

I got a better understand on commands, how packages are managed.

I also created a small script that will check for the current enabled repos on
systems that use RPM packages

Today I Finished reading chapter 11, I've reached page 273

I had a lot of practice with the subject of users and groups as it was recently 
refererenced on the other book I was reading.( The Linux Programming Interface )
Reading on ACLs was new to me, interesting topic 

Monday, June 03, 2024

Today I finished chapter 12 whichn talks about partitions, filesystems, swap
and LVM.

I had a little practice with it already while installing Arch a few days ago,
in which I used LVM and configured the boot, home and data partitions manually.

The next set of chapters are on "Becoming a Linux Server Administator" 
Is going to be great.
