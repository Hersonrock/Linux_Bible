Today I studied from page 147 to 156, $((156-147)) pages :)
The subject was Writing simple Shell scripts using
- escape characters
- variables
- variables expansion
- shebang lines 
- use of  '' `` "" 
- parameter expansion (chopping and expanding unset variables)
- if then else statements
- test expressions

As a project I performed

- Creating a remote git repo for my studies of this book
- Creating an Alias to set the date on this journal and setting it on ~/.bashrc
(Sources p. 68;81;84)
alias today="date +'%A, %B %d, %Y'"
- Creating a dummy script, in which I got help from :
